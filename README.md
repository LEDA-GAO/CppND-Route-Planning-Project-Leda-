## Things implemented and learned from this project

* ### A* search algorithm 
By implementing the A* search algorithm, I built a route planner in C++ that can find a path between any two points on a real map. 

* ###  C++ standard library
Data structures and algorithms are learnd by using the C++ standard library. 

* ###  Build tool(cmake and make) and head files
Build tool(cmake and make) and head files are used to compile and organize the project. 

* ###  Pointer, reference, and object-oriented programming
Pointer, reference, and object-oriented programming are also practiced. 

## Final Results

The final route found by the program looks like the figure below.
